# Personal Tips and Branding Resources

It's a new year and time to revamp my persona branding efforts. While I'm comfortable admitting that I'm not an expert on the topic, I have had some success with the path I've chosen. If you're just starting out on yourself then the following tips and resources should help you understand why and how to start your personal branding journey.

## Why Do I Need a Personal Brand as a Software Developer

In software development today it's more important now than it ever has been to have an online presence. Chances are that your next employer will find you, or about you by using a web search. The concept of building a personal brand ensures that your name and skills are marketed online in the best way possible. Personal branding is done by creating online profiles, publishing content, and sharing your message. 

### Search Yourself 

By flooding the web with positive information about yourself, **you gain control over search results about you**. If you're not actively contributing to a personal brand, try searching for yourself and see what you find. Because of years of following a few simple rules that I'm about to outline, I know that if you search my name you'll find: one of my social media profiles, an article I've written, or project I've worked on. This is something you can accomplish too by following the remaining tips and resources.

## Be Consistent

Consistency is the key to promoting a quality image. If you look to any brand you consider "high quality" you'll find consistency. Consistency gives a consumer (or employer) the certainty that what they are getting is always of the same quality.

When filling out online profiles be sure to use a master template. Whenever possible use the same bio across twitter, facebook, GitHub, and other sites.
