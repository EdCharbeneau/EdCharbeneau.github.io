title: Goodbye JavaScript, Hello C# Blazor
key: goodbye-javascript-hello-blazor
---

For .NET developers, writing client side C# has always been a pipe dream. With the introduction of Blazor this all changes. Blazor is a .NET web framework that runs in any browser. Blazor uses the latest in web standards, WebAssembly. This means no plugins, transpilation, or JavaScript are needed.

In this session weâ€™ll explore what Blazor means for web development and learn about how this experiment at Microsoft is shaping up. Blazor runs in the browser on a real .NET runtime (Mono) implemented in WebAssembly that executes normal .NET assemblies.

Subject: `HTML, CSS, WebAssembly, .NET`
