## Bionic Monitor

[Bionic Monitor](https://github.com/bmsantos/BionicMonitor) is a live reloader for Blazor applications and [Bionic](https://bmsantos.github.io/bionic/) based projects.


## Bionic 

[Bionic](https://bmsantos.github.io/bionic/) is an Ionic Framework CLI clone for Blazor projects.

The goal is to provide an easy, modular, and repeatable way of creating, building, and deploying Blazor projects.

Features:

- SCSS Style Isolation: Pages and components have their own SCSS file for quick and easy styling.
- Hot Rebuild: Automatically rebuild modified source or SCSS code (hot reloading not available, yet).
- Component Generation: Quickly generate Blazor pages, layouts, components, and services.
- Modular Platform Architecture: Project deployment platforms are provided through plugins and isolated within each project.
- Blast Scripting: Execute a group of commands under a single target name.

## Blazor-Fluxor

[Blazor-Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-fluxor) is a zero boilerplate Flux/Redux library for the new Microsoft aspdotnet Blazor project.

The aim of Fluxor is to create a single-state store approach to front-end development in Blazor without the headaches typically associated with other implementations, such as the overwhelming amount of boiler-plate code required just to add a very basic feature.

## Blazor 0.6.0-preview

Template based components are coming in the next release of Blazor. Currently you can grab the [Blazor 0.6.0 preview release](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/releases/tag/0.6.0-preview1) and test out the new feature. If you experience any issues, use this opportunity to report back to the Blazor project so it can be addressed before the full release.
