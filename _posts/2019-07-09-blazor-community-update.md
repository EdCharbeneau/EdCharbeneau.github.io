This month has been one of the busiest months for Blazor and the show Blazor StateHasChanged. With preview 7 imminent it's important to take a minute to reflect on all of the great community content that has been shared into the Blazor ecosystem by the hard working and enthusiastic community.

## Blazing Blog Posts

There are a few Blazor fans that consistently surprise me with their ability to pump out excellent blog posts on a weekly basis. Below you'll find a quick summary of just a few of these many posts. Not only is it worth checking out the following links, but make sure you follow the authors as well so you can catch the content as it's published.

### Telerik

Of course, I couldn't help but add a shout out to the fantastic engineers I work with a Progress on the Telerik UI for Blazor product. These folks have been hard at work making sure our awesome suite of [UI components is up to date with each Blazor release](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/telerik-ui-for-blazor-1-3-0-is-here).

### BlazePort

If you want to see what it's like to build a full stack C# application in Blazor, then come join me each week as we build BlazePort. BlazePort is a fictional space travel app that incorporates ML.NET, Blazor, and ASP.NET Core 3.0.
