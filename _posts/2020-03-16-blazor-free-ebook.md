At the 2017 Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) Summit I watched Steve Sanderson unveil his experimental framework to a room full of .NET developers. I watched the room fill with excitement and give rounds of standing applause. The excitement validated my own opinion that this was something .NET developers like myself have always wanted for the web. I wrote this book to help the .NET community quickly grasp what Blazor has to offer and share in the excitement we all felt at the MVP Summit.

Since that moment I have made many blog posts about the topic which have become outdated with each monthly release of Blazor. I have taken the best of those blog posts, reviewed, updated, and rewrote portions of them into the book along with **a wealth of brand-new material**. By compiling my best works into a single piece as an e-book, this single source of knowledge can be kept up to date with new releases.

What you'll find in the Free Blazor e-book:

- What is WebAssembly
- Component Basics
- Blazor Code Behind
- Data Binding
- JavaScript Interop
- Razor Class Libraries
- and much more...
