## Migrating Blazing Pizza (server side Blazor and client side Blazor)

In this article Michael Washington compares the structure and the differences between the client side version of the Blazor Blazing Pizza example and the server side version.

The primary difference is that the server side version of Blazor renders everything on the server.
