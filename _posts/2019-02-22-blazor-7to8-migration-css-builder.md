On this weeks Blazor StateHasChanged we migrate an existing 0.7.0 project to 0.8.0. This is a good learning experience to see what has changed in the underlying framework bits since the move to Razor Components on ASP.NET Core. There were quite a few name space changes in the framework including: Razor Components name space, base component class names, and even JavaScript dependency names. We also see how to tackle conditional CSS Classes with a simple pattern that gives syntactic sugar to building CSS strings.

## CSS Builder

When building complex components for ASP.NET Razor Components there are often CSS classes generated by multiple factors. Styles can often be added by system & component state, public parameters, and static base CSS classes. Combining many CSS classes together doesn't scale well, and when components get large it can be tough to reason about. The CSS builder pattern fixes this problem by offering a easy to repeat, easy to read pattern to use across components in a project. A clean code approach to conditional CSS in Razor Components.
