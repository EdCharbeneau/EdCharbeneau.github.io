Hello Beer City Code workshop attendees. Thank you for purchasing tickets to my workshop "Build your first full-stack Blazor app". We have a packed day learning about Blazor the exciting new framework from Microsoft that for the first time enables C# in the browser.

# IMPORTANT Prerequisites
## ** YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO PARTICIPATE **

I can't stress enough that you install the next 4 items in order to participate in the workshop. If you do not use the guide below, you may be pairing up with someone else who did.

## 1. Install Visual Studio 2019 Preview (latest update)

Install the **PREVIEW** edition of Visual Studio 2019. Community edition or higher is acceptable as long as it is preview. Visual Studio 2019 (RTM) does not contain all of the tooling needed and support for Visual Studio Code is spotty at best.

The installer can be found here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/

## 2. ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview 5

Install the .NET Core 3.0 Preview 5 release. Blazor is also in preview and requires the latest release to work properly.

The installer for x64 and x86 can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0

_If you don't know what installer to grab, the ".NET Core Installer: x64" is most common._

## 3. Blazor Visual Studio Extension

Install the Blazor extension for Visual Studio. This contains the Blazor template needed to complete the workshop.

Install the extension by clicking download from here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aspnet.blazor 

## 4. Blazor CLI

Install the dotnet command line (CLI) templates. The CLI templates contain an additional template not accessible in Visual Studio, it's also a good safety net for troubleshooting.

From the command line run:

```
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates::3.0.0-preview5-19227-01
```

## What to expect Friday

I'm excited to teach you all about Blazor. I've been working closely with the ASP.NET team and Progress/Telerik teams over the past year developing the Telerik UI for Blazor product. Since Blazor was premiered a the Microsoft MVP summit last year, I have worked full time with Blazor building components, coding live on Twitch, and presenting at meetup groups, conferences, and even Channel 9. Please use the workshop as an opportunity to ask me anything you would like to know about Blazor.

We have a lot of material to cover, so plan to start promptly Friday at 9AM. I'll begin with a short presentation explaining how Blazor is able to run .NET in the browser, then we will start working on code exercises. We will be using the Blazing Pizza Workshop designed by Steve Sanderson and Ryan Nowak (ASP.NET Team). This step by step workshop will teach the fundamentals while creating a fully functioning web application to simulate a pizza ordering service.

Developing full stack web applications using .NET tooling and C# is something that will empower .NET developers to be extremely productive on the web. I'm looking forward to guiding you through the workshop and answering your questions.
