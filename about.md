I'm Ed, a web enthusiast, speaker, writer, design admirer, and Developer Advocate for Progress. I have designed and developed web based applications for business, manufacturing, systems integration as well as customer facing websites. I enjoy geeking out to cool new tech, brainstorming about future technology, and admiring great design.

I frequently travel the eastern states of the U.S. speaking at conferences. You'll find me talking about ASP.NET MVC, responsive web design, UX, and clean coding practices. In 2016 became a Microsoft MVP for Visual Studio and Tools.
